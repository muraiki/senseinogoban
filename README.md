# Sensei no Goban - 先生の碁盤

Sensei no Goban is an online [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28game%29) board that shows all of your movements; you don't have to drop the stone. It does not force you to use the rules of Go, so it is ideal for teaching games.

SnG is written in Javascript, using [Meteor](http://meteor.com) as its framework and [Raphaël](http://raphaeljs.com) for rendering SVG images.

# How to use

You can try SnG out at http://senseinogoban.meteor.com  Be aware that this is a public site, so hopefully people won't abuse it! In the future I plan on adding public and private rooms, along with other features.

# How to run it yourself

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install [Meteor](http://meteor.com) (it's very easy to do!)
3. From the directory where you cloned the repo, run `meteor` and then point your web browser at `localhost:3000`

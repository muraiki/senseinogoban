# Sensei no Goban - 先生の碁盤

Sensei no Goban is an online [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28game%29) board that shows all of your movements; you don't have to drop the stone. It does not force you to use the rules of Go, so it is ideal for teaching games.

I wanted to recreate the feel of playing in person and watching the other person move their pieces, instead of simply seeing a piece pop into existence on the next turn. I was inspired by a demo that I played that used a similar concept albeit with physics and 3d; unfortunately, I can't recall the name of the game and haven't been able to find it online.

SnG is written in Javascript, using [Meteor](http://meteor.com) as its framework and [Raphaël](http://raphaeljs.com) for rendering SVG images.

# How to use

You can try SnG out at http://senseinogoban.meteor.com  Be aware that this is a public site, so hopefully people won't abuse it! In the future I plan on adding public and private rooms, along with other features.

# How to run it yourself

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install [Meteor](http://meteor.com) (it's very easy to do!)
3. From the directory where you cloned the repo, run `meteor` and then point your web browser at `localhost:3000`
